`This project is a real-time Network Security Monitoring and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) built using Python. It captures live network traffic, analyzes packets, detects suspicious activities such as port scanning, packet flooding, and SYN flood attacks, and logs all events into a structured forensic database. The system provides both console-based and GUI-based monitoring, making it suitable for educational, research, and cybersecurity practice purposes.`
